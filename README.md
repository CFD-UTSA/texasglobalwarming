# Project Information

Global warming is defined as the gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth’s atmosphere caused by greenhouse emissions. These greenhouse emissions can be listed as Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (NO),  Ozone (O3), and various other pollutants. 

### Scope:
The scope of this project will focus on determining if, over the past 5 years (2016-2021), Texas’ weather conditions have been affected by its rapidly growing cities’ pollution output. In order to conduct this study, several data sets will be obtained containing the following information: 1) measured solar irradiance in Edinburg, Tx (conducted by UT Pan American), 2) pollution (Ozone) measured within a locational range spanning from Corpus Christi, Laredo, Brownsville and Mission, Tx, and 3) measured air temperature in Edinburg, Tx. 

It is desired to investigate whether there is a correlation between the amount of Ozone (O3) measured to that of the amount of solar irradiation measured in southern Texas. Ozone, usually harmful to humans in large quantities, is helpful to the earth’s atmosphere by blocking the amount of solar irradiance entering through. This interaction would be investigated and validated by analyzing meteorological temperature data (collected in same area of the solar irradiance data). Analysis of the data will include time-based plots, statistical analysis of data (means), probability density functions (PDF’s), correlations, and Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) of data.

### Hypothesis:
It is hypothesized that due to the predicted increase in solar irradiance entering the atmosphere, Texas’ temperature climate will also increase. This increase will be derived by the effects of greenhouse gases present in the earth’s atmosphere.
